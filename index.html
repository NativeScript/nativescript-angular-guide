<p><img src="images/banner.png" class="banner-image"></p>
<p>NativeScript’s first-class Angular support extends the Angular 2 runtime, making it possible for you to build <em>native</em> iOS and Android applications using the same framework—and in some cases the same code—that you use to build Angular 2 web apps.</p>
<p>Let’s look at how it all works by building an app.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>: Although NativeScript itself is a production-ready framework that drives many apps in the app stores today, NativeScript’s Angular integration is still in an alpha stage. If you run into issues when using the Angular integration, please report them on <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular">https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular</a>. If you’re looking for a guide on using the production-ready flavor of NativeScript head to the <a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/start/getting-started">official Getting Started Guide</a>.</p>
<p><strong>WARNING #2 🚧</strong>: This guide is being actively written. If you choose to go through this today you’ll certainly find grammatical errors and steps that just don’t work. If you find an error in the guide please report the problem at <a href="https://github.com/tjvantoll/nativescript-angular-guide">https://github.com/tjvantoll/nativescript-angular-guide</a>. Pull requests are also welcome 😀</p>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="what-you-re-building">What you&#39;re building</h3>
<p>This guide will walk you through building <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries">Groceries</a>, a groceries management app that does the following things:</p>
<ul>
<li>Connects to an existing RESTful service.</li>
<li>Provides user registration and login.</li>
<li>Lets authenticated users add and delete groceries from a list.</li>
<li>Runs cross-platform (iOS and Android).</li>
</ul>
<p>If you follow along to the end, here&#39;s what the finished app will look like on iOS:</p>
<p><img src="/images/chapter0/ios/1.png" alt="login">
<img src="/images/chapter0/ios/2.png" alt="register">
<img src="/images/chapter0/ios/3.png" alt="list"></p>
<p>And here&#39;s what the app will look like on Android:</p>
<p><img src="/images/chapter0/android/1.png" alt="">
<img src="/images/chapter0/android/2.png" alt="">
<img src="/images/chapter0/android/3.png" alt=""></p>
<h3 id="prerequisites">Prerequisites</h3>
<p>This guide assumes that you have some basic knowledge of JavaScript, CSS, and your development machine’s terminal. More specifically:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>JavaScript</strong>: You should know basic JavaScript concepts, such as how functions, if statements, and loops work.</li>
<li><strong>CSS</strong>: You should know how to write simple CSS selectors, and know how to apply CSS rules as name/value pairs.</li>
<li><strong>The terminal</strong>: You should know how to open a terminal or command-line prompt on your development machine, how to change directories, and how to execute commands.</li>
</ul>
<p>This guide will <em>not</em>, however, assume you have any knowledge of Angular 2. When background Angular 2 expertise will help you understand a concept, this guide will link you to the appropriate places in the <a href="https://angular.io/docs/ts/latest/">angular.io</a> documentation.</p>
<p>With that out of the way, let’s get started!</p>

				<h2 id="getting-up-and-running">Getting up and running</h2>
<p>In this chapter you&#39;re going to start with the basics, including installing the NativeScript CLI, starting a new project, and getting your first app up and running.</p>
<h3 id="install-nativescript-and-configure-your-environment">Install NativeScript and configure your environment</h3>
<p>The NativeScript CLI has a few system requirements you must have in place before building NativeScript apps. As a first step, start by going through the instructions for your operating system:</p>
<ul>
<li><a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-win">Windows</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-os-x">OS X</a></li>
<li><a href="http://docs.nativescript.org/start/ns-setup-linux">Linux</a></li>
</ul>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: If you&#39;re a bit overwhelmed by these requirements, or if you&#39;re looking for a way to build iOS apps on Windows, you might be interested in <a href="http://www.telerik.com/platform">using NativeScript in the Telerik Platform</a>. The Telerik Platform provides tooling for NativeScript apps, including the ability to perform iOS and Android builds in the cloud, which removes the need to complete these system requirements.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>After completing the setup you should have two commands available from your terminal: <code>tns</code>—which is short for <b>T</b>elerik <b>N</b>ative<b>S</b>cript—and <code>nativescript</code>. The two commands are equivalent, so we&#39;ll stick with the shorter <code>tns</code>.</p>
<p>You can verify the installation was successful by running <code>tns</code> in your terminal. You should see something like this:</p>
<pre><code>$ tns
# NativeScript
┌─────────┬─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┐
│ Usage   │ Synopsis                                                            │
│ General │ $ tns &lt;Command&gt; [Command Parameters] [--command &lt;Options&gt;]          │
│ Alias   │ $ nativescript &lt;Command&gt; [Command Parameters] [--command &lt;Options&gt;] │
└─────────┴─────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────────┘
</code></pre><h3 id="start-your-app">Start your app</h3>
<p>With the NativeScript CLI installed, it&#39;s time to start building your app. Normally, you would <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/NativeScript-cli#create-project">use the <code>tns create</code> command to create an empty NativeScript application</a>. For this guide however, we&#39;ve scaffolded out a boilerplate project to act as a starting point for <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries">Groceries</a>.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Get the Groceries starting point
</h4>

<p>Navigate to a folder where you want to keep your app code:</p>
<div class="no-copy-button"></div>

<pre><code>cd the-folder-you-want-groceries-to-be-in
</code></pre><p>Next, assuming you have <a href="http://www.git-scm.com/">git installed</a>, clone the Groceries repo from GitHub:</p>
<pre><code>git clone https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries.git
</code></pre><p>After that, change to the newly cloned repo&#39;s folder:</p>
<pre><code>cd sample-Groceries
</code></pre><p>Finally, switch to the “angular-start” branch for this guide&#39;s starting point:</p>
<pre><code>git checkout angular-start
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP:</strong> The “angular-end” branch has the final state of this guide&#39;s tutorial. Feel free to <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries/tree/angular-end">refer to the branch on GitHub</a> if you get stuck.</p>
</blockquote>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<h3 id="add-target-development-platforms">Add target development platforms</h3>
<p>Your app is now set up, but before you run it, you need to initialize a platform-specific native project for each platform you intend to target.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Add the iOS and Android platforms
</h4>

<p>If you&#39;re on a Mac, start by adding the iOS platform:</p>
<pre><code>tns platform add ios
</code></pre><p>Next, add the Android platform with the same <code>platform add</code> command:</p>
<pre><code>tns platform add android
</code></pre><div class="exercise-end"></div>

<blockquote>
<p><strong>IMPORTANT:</strong> You can add platforms only for SDKs that you already have installed on your development machine. If you get errors running <code>tns platform add</code>, refer back to the section on <a href="#install-nativescript-and-configure-your-environment">setting up your development environment</a>.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The <code>platform add</code> command adds a folder called <code>platforms</code> to your project, and copies all of the required native SDKs into this folder. When you build the application, the NativeScript CLI will copy your application code into the <code>platforms</code> folder so that a native binary can be created.</p>
<h3 id="running-your-app">Running your app</h3>
<p>With the platform initialization complete, you can run your app in an emulator or on devices.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Run your app
</h4>

<p>If you&#39;re on a Mac, start by running the app in an iOS simulator with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>tns run ios --emulator
</code></pre><p>If all went well, you should see something like this:</p>
<p><img src="/images/chapter1/ios/1.png" alt="iOS login"></p>
<p>Next, run your app on an Android emulator with the following command:</p>
<pre><code>tns run android --emulator
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><strong>WARNING</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>You must have at least one Android AVD (Android Virtual Device) configured for this command to work. If you get an error, try <a href="http://developer.telerik.com/featured/using-android-emulator-hybrid-mobile-apps-telerik-appbuilder/#managing-avds">setting up an AVD</a> and then run the command again.</li>
<li>If you&#39;re using <a href="https://www.genymotion.com">Genymotion</a>, launch your Genymotion virtual device, and then run <code>tns run android</code>.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<p>If all went well, you should see your app running in an Android emulator:</p>
<p><img src="/images/chapter1/android/1.png" alt="Android login"></p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div>

<p>Here are a few other tips for running NativeScript apps.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>:</p>
<ul>
<li>To run on a USB-connected Android or iOS device, use the same <code>run</code> command without the <code>--emulator</code> flag—i.e. <code>tns run android</code> and <code>tns run ios</code>.</li>
<li>The <code>tns device</code> command lists all USB-connected iOS devices, USB-connected Android devices, and Genymotion virtual devices that <code>tns run</code> can deploy to. Note that <code>tns device</code> does not list iOS simulators.</li>
</ul>
</blockquote>
<h3 id="development-workflow">Development workflow</h3>
<p>At this point, you have the NativeScript CLI downloaded and installed, as well as the iOS and Android dependencies that you need to run your app. Now you need a good workflow that lets you make changes and see results fast. For that we’ll use the <code>tns livesync</code> command.</p>
<h4 class="exercise-start">
    <b>Exercise</b>: Your first NativeScript change
</h4>

<p>If your previous <code>tns run ios</code> or <code>tns run android</code> task is still running, type <code>Ctrl+C</code> in your terminal to kill it.</p>
<p>If you’re on a Mac, start an iOS livesync watcher by executing the following command:</p>
<pre><code>tns livesync ios --emulator --watch
</code></pre><p>If you have an Android emulator running, start an Android livesync watcher by executing the following command:</p>
<pre><code>tns livesync android --watch
</code></pre><p>The <code>tns livesync</code> command updates your app running on an emulator or device by actually transferring the updated source code. By adding the <code>--watch</code> flag, the <code>livesync</code> command additionally watches the files in your NativeScript project. Whenever one of those files changes, the command detects the update, and patches your app on the fly with the updated code.</p>
<p>To see this in action let’s make a small update to your app. Open your project’s <code>app/app.component.ts</code> file in your text editor of choice and change <code>&lt;Label text=&quot;hello world&quot; /&gt;</code> to <code>&lt;Label text=&quot;hello NativeScript&quot; /&gt;</code>. Save the file and you should see the app relaunch and the updated text displayed.</p>
<div class="exercise-end"></div> 

<p>In addition to updating your NativeScript app on the fly, the livesync command also shows the output of <code>console.log()</code> statements as your app executes, as well as stack traces when things go wrong. So if your app crashes at any time during this guide, look to the terminal for a detailed report of the problem.</p>
<p>The iOS and Android logs can be a bit noisy, so you might have to scroll up a bit to find the actual problem. For example if I try to call <code>foo.bar()</code> when <code>foo</code> does not exist, here&#39;s the information I get on iOS:</p>
<pre><code>/app/path/to/file.js:14:8: JS ERROR ReferenceError: Can&#39;t find variable: foo
1   0xe3dc0 NativeScript::FFICallback&lt;NativeScript::ObjCMethodCallback&gt;::ffiClosureCallback(ffi_cif*, void*, void**, void*)
</code></pre><p>And here&#39;s the same information in the Android logs:</p>
<pre><code>E/TNS.Native( 2063): ReferenceError: foo is not defined
E/TNS.Native( 2063): File: &quot;/data/data/org.nativescript.groceries/files/app/./views/login/login.js, line: 13, column: 4
</code></pre><blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: When you&#39;re trying to debug a problem, try adding <code>console.log()</code> statements in your JavaScript code—exactly as you would in a browser-based application.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that you&#39;ve created an app, configured your environment, and set up your app to run on iOS and Android, you&#39;re ready to start digging into the files that make up a NativeScript app.</p>

			</div>
			<div class="chapter">
				<h2 id="building-the-ui">Building the UI</h2>
<p>Before you start coding the Groceries app it&#39;s important to understand a NativeScript app&#39;s folder structure. It&#39;ll help you understand where to place new files, as well as a bit of what&#39;s going on with NativeScript under the hood.</p>
<p>Go ahead and open your app&#39;s <code>sample-Groceries</code> folder in your text editor of choice and let&#39;s dig in.</p>
<h3 id="directory-structure">Directory structure</h3>
<p>To keep things simple, let&#39;s start by looking at the outer structure of the Groceries app:</p>
<pre><code>.
└── sample-Groceries
    ├── app
    │   └── ...
    ├── node_modules
    │   ├── angular2
    │   ├── nativescript-angular
    │   ├── tns-core-modules
    │   └── ...
    ├── package.json
    └── platforms
        ├── android
        └── ios
</code></pre><p>Here&#39;s what these various files and folders do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>app</strong>: This folder contains all the development resources you need to build your app. You&#39;ll be spending most of your time editing the files in here.</li>
<li><strong>node_modules</strong>: This folder contains your app&#39;s npm module dependencies, including Angular 2, TypeScript, and the other modules NativeScript needs to build your app.</li>
<li><strong>node_modules/angular2</strong>: This folder contains the Angular 2 source code. NativeScript does not alter the core Angular 2 source code in any way.</li>
<li><strong>node_modules/nativescript-angular</strong>: This folder contains the module that builds on top of Angular 2 to integrate NativeScript-specific functionality. The source code for this module lives at <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular">https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript-angular</a>.</li>
<li><strong>node_modules/tns-core-modules</strong>: This folder contains your app&#39;s NativeScript modules, which are a series of NativeScript-provided JavaScript modules you&#39;ll use to build your app. Each module contains the platform-specific code needed to implement some feature—the camera, http calls, the file system, and so forth—exposed through a platform-agnostic API (e.g. <code>camera.takePicture()</code>). We&#39;ll look at some examples momentarily. The source code for these modules lives at <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript">https://github.com/NativeScript/nativescript</a>.</li>
<li><strong>package.json</strong>: This file contains your app&#39;s configuration details, such as your app id, the version of NativeScript you&#39;re using, and also which npm modules your app uses. We&#39;ll take a closer look at how to use this file when we talk about using npm modules in <a href="#plugins-and-npm-modules">chapter 5</a>.</li>
<li><strong>platforms</strong>: This folder contains the platform-specific code NativeScript needs to build native iOS and Android apps. For example in the <code>android</code> folder you&#39;ll find things like your project&#39;s <code>AndroidManifest.xml</code> and .apk executable files. Similarly, the <code>ios</code> folder contains the Groceries&#39; Xcode project and .ipa executables. Note, users on Windows machines will not have an <code>ios</code> folder.</li>
</ul>
<p>The NativeScript CLI manages the <code>platforms</code> folder for you as you develop and run your app; therefore, it&#39;s a best practice to treat the <code>platforms</code> folder as generated code. The Groceries app includes the <code>platforms</code> folder in its <a href="https://github.com/NativeScript/sample-Groceries/blob/master/.gitignore"><code>.gitignore</code></a> to exclude its files from source control.</p>
<p>Next, let&#39;s dig into the <code>app</code> folder, as that&#39;s where you&#39;ll be spending the majority of your time.</p>
<pre><code>.
└── sample-Groceries
    ├── app
    │   ├── App_Resources
    │   │   ├── Android
    │   │   └── iOS
    │   ├── pages
    │   │   └── login
    │   │       ├── login.js
    │   │       └── login.xml
    │   ├── shared
    │   │   └── ...
    │   ├── app.css
    │   ├── app.component.ts
    │   ├── main.ts
    │   └── ...
    └── ...
</code></pre><p>Here&#39;s what these various files and folders do:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong>App_Resources</strong>: This folder contains platform-specific resources such as icons, splash screens, and configuration files. The NativeScript CLI takes care of injecting these resources into the appropriate places in the <code>platforms</code> folder when you execute <code>tns run</code>.</li>
<li><strong>shared</strong>: This folder, specific to the Groceries app, contains any files you need to share across views in your app. In the Groceries app, you&#39;ll find a few view model objects and a <code>config.js</code> file used to share configuration variables like API keys.</li>
<li><strong>views</strong>: This folder contains the code to build your app&#39;s views, each of which will have a subfolder in <code>views</code>. Each view is made up of an XML file, a JavaScript file, and an optional CSS file. The groceries app contains three folders for its three views.</li>
<li><strong>app.css</strong>: This file contains global styles for your app. We&#39;ll dig into app styling in <a href="#css">section 2.3</a>.</li>
<li><strong>app.js</strong>: This file sets up your application&#39;s starting module and initializes the app.</li>
</ul>
<p>Let&#39;s start with <code>app/app.js</code>, as it&#39;s the starting point for NativeScript apps. Your <code>app.js</code> contains the three lines below: </p>
<pre><code class="lang-JavaScript">var applicationModule = require(&quot;application&quot;);
applicationModule.mainModule = &quot;views/login/login&quot;;
applicationModule.start();
</code></pre>
<p>Here, you&#39;re requiring, or importing, the <a href="{{site.baseurl}}/ApiReference/application/HOW-TO">NativeScript application module</a>. Then, you set its <code>mainModule</code>, or the starting screen of your app to be the login screen, which lives in your app&#39;s <code>views/login</code> folder.</p>
<blockquote>
<p><strong>TIP</strong>: JavaScript modules in NativeScript follow the <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/CommonJS">CommonJS specification</a>. This means you can use the <a href="http://wiki.commonjs.org/wiki/Modules/1.1#Module_Context"><code>require()</code> method</a> to import modules, as is done above, as well as use the <code>export</code> keyword to expose a module&#39;s properties and methods, which we&#39;ll look at later in this chapter. These are the same constructs Node.js uses for JavaScript modules, so if you know how to use Node.js modules, you already know how to use NativeScript modules.</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Now that your app is ready for development, let&#39;s add some UI components to make your login screen show more than some basic text.</p>
